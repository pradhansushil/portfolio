Problem 1: The CTA button wouldn't shift downward as expected.

Attempts:
- Applied `padding-bottom` to the `.hero` section.
- Tried moving the same padding to the `header` selector.
- Converted `.hero` into a flex container. This resolved the issue, 
  but I didn’t understand why. I assumed that if it works with flexbox, it should be possible to achieve the same result without using it.
- Asked ChatGPT for clarification.
- Realized that `<a>` is an inline element by default, so margins and 
  paddings don’t behave as expected unless it’s changed to `block` or `inline-block`.

Fix:
- Applied `display: inline-block` to the CTA to retain control over 
  spacing without it occupying the full width.

Problem 2: The "About Me" section didn’t look right due to the default indentation of each paragraph.

Fix:
- Added `padding-bottom` between paragraphs to create clearer 
  separation, similar to the formatting seen on blog-style websites.

Problem 3: The last `.project-tile` card appeared shorter than the others.

Reason:
- This is expected behavior with CSS Grid. Since only one card had 
  substantial content, the next three visually aligned based on that height. However, the last (fifth) card wrapped to a new row and had no height reference, so it shrank to its content’s minimum height.

Attempts:
- Tried setting a fixed minimum height (`min-height: 300px`) on `.
  project-content`, but it felt rigid.
Fix:
- Added `grid-auto-rows: 1fr` to `.project-tile`, ensuring that all 
  cards in the grid have equal height, regardless of row wrapping or content length.

Problem 4: The hamburger toggle button wasn't hiding the navigation bar as expected on screens 480px wide.

Reason:
  - The rule targeting .navbar ul in the @media (max-width: 1024px) 
    block had higher specificity and was overriding the display: none; rule applied to .nav-menu for smaller screens.

Attempts:

  - Added !important to display: flex; inside #menu-toggle:checked + .
    hamburger + .nav-menu {} to force it to override conflicting rules.

  - Used DevTools to inspect .nav-menu behavior and determine what 
    styles were being applied.

Fix:
  - Updated all instances of .navbar ul to .nav-menu to maintain  
    consistent class usage and avoid conflicts.
